### Project Title
Bicycle-sharing in Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC.

### Description
This project used python code to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. As a result, it provided information including popular times of travel, popular stations and trip, trip duration and user information.

This project used data from bike-sharing systems in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year
